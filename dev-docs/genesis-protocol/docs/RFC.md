# **RFC-AS-CONVERSATION.md**

## RFC as a Living Conversation

This document explains **how RFCs are used** in this project.

---

## 1. RFCs Are Not Decrees

RFCs in Tetragrammatron-OS are:

* records of understanding
* snapshots of alignment
* formalized conversations

They are not immutable law.

---

## 2. RFCs Capture Discovery

Each RFC answers:

* *What was observed?*
* *What invariant emerged?*
* *What projection is permitted?*
* *What is explicitly excluded?*

RFCs are written **after understanding**, not before.

---

## 3. Structure of an RFC

Each RFC must include:

1. **Context**
2. **Observation**
3. **Invariant**
4. **Allowed Projections**
5. **Rejected Alternatives**
6. **Compatibility Impact**
7. **Future Notes**

---

## 4. Conversation Over Consensus

Disagreement is allowed.
Forking is allowed.
Exploration is allowed.

What is not allowed:

* silent semantic drift
* numeric shortcuts
* unbounded abstraction

---

## 5. RFC Numbering Is Organizational Only

RFC numbers:

* do not imply hierarchy
* do not imply authority
* do not imply completeness

They are bookmarks, not ordinals.

---

## 6. Merging RFCs

An RFC may be merged only if:

* it preserves existing invariants
* it introduces no hidden numeric authority
* it does not collapse relations into metrics

---

## 7. RFC Lifecycle

RFCs may be:

* superseded
* refined
* split
* reinterpreted

But never silently rewritten.

---

## 8. Conversation Is the System

The system exists because:

* ideas were tested
* assumptions were challenged
* relations were discovered

RFCs preserve that process.

---

## 9. Final Statement

> Tetragrammatron-OS is not finished.
> It is **understanding made executable**.
> RFCs are how we remember *why* it works.
