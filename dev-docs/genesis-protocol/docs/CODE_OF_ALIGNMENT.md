## Code of Alignment

This document defines **alignment**, not behavior.
It is not a code of conduct.
It is not a moral statement.
It is not enforceable law.

It exists to prevent semantic collapse.

---

## 1. Alignment Over Agreement

You do not need to agree with:

* the metaphors
* the language
* the framing

You **must** align with the invariants.

Alignment means:

* preserving meaning
* respecting boundaries
* avoiding false authority

---

## 2. Observation Is the Highest Authority

Claims must be grounded in:

* observable behavior
* reproducible traces
* explicit relations

Appeals to tradition, standards, or popularity are not sufficient.

---

## 3. No Hidden Hierarchies

There is no:

* privileged contributor
* authoritative subsystem
* sacred abstraction

Every part of the system is subject to projection and reinterpretation.

---

## 4. Boundaries Are Sacred

Do not cross boundaries silently.

Examples:

* Hardware defining semantics
* POSIX defining identity
* Visualization defining structure
* Numbers defining truth

Boundaries may be crossed **only by explicit projection**.

---

## 5. Reduction Is Not Destruction

Simplifying is allowed.
Removing is allowed.
Collapsing meaning is not.

If something is reduced:

* show how it can be reconstructed
* show what invariant survives

---

## 6. Growth Is Not Inflation

Adding structure must:

* increase expressiveness
* not increase authority
* not harden assumptions

More code is not more meaning.

---

## 7. Self-Reference Requires Care

Self-describing systems are fragile.

When working on:

* bootstrapping
* self-hosting
* meta-layers

You must:

* expose the boundary
* make collapse explicit
* preserve reversibility

---

## 8. Alignment Test

Before committing, ask:

* Does this make observation easier?
* Does this preserve semantic invariants?
* Does this avoid numeric authority?
* Does this respect projection boundaries?

If yes → aligned
If no → revise

---

## 9. Final Statement

> Alignment is not obedience.
> Alignment is coherence.
> Coherence is what allows freedom without collapse.
