 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
 free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software
 Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software;
 it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.
 You can apply it to your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
 you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that
 you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,
 and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to the GNU General Public License, Version 3. 
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
 for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
 form of a work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the duration of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your right
 of fair use or fair equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of, or be effective to
 restrict, the exercise of, or are conditions imposed on, the exercise of
 the rights granted by this License.  This License explicitly allows
 linking non-covered modules with covered modules, and the resulting work is
 covered by this License.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
 of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the
 terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey
 machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of
 these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical
    product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable custom physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical
    product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable custom
    physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying
    of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a
    network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable custom physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than
    your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
 treated as if they were included in this License, to the extent that they
 are valid under applicable law.  Additional permissions that are applicable to only
 part of the Program, or to the Program as a whole, shall be treated as
 if they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under
 applicable law.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
 this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph
 of section 11).

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
 run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
 occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
 to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing
 other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered
 work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this
 License.  Therefore, if you modify or copy the Program, you indicate
 your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensor to run, modify and propagate
 that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for
 enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
 License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
 work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
 owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
 hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
 by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
 but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
 consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of
 this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent
 sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
 use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise run, modify and
 propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
 agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
 (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
 sue for a patent infringement), that commits the grantee to refrain from
 exercising a patent right with respect to the Program, or prohibits the
 grantee from exercising such a patent right, with respect to the Program.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
 you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered
 work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
 and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it
 at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
 to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
 the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
 License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
 permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
 under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
 combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
 License will continue to apply to the part which is a covered work,
 but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
 section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
 combination as such.

                              14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
 GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
 similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
 Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License
 "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
 following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any
 later version published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License,
 you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
 versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
 statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose
 that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or
 different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
 author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later
 version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
 COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
 BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  THE
 ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
 YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
 ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

                  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
 THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
 INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
 DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
 PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
 EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.

                  17. Interpretation of Sections.

  If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
 provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
 enforceable.  Any provision of this License which is no longer valid
 shall be terminated with effect at the time that the provision ceases to be valid.

                  18. COMMERCIAL AND ETHICAL RESTRICTIONS.

                  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
    Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your
    option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
    into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
    Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
