* What Is This?

GENESIS-PROTOCOL is a minimal, formal system for defining *structure before interpretation*.

It separates:
- What exists (hardware/provenance)
- What means (software/semantics)
- What projects (syntax/view)

* Quick Start

1. Read [[file:docs/RFC-0001-TPPM.md][RFC-0001-TPPM]] for the formal specification
2. Read [[file:GENESIS.org][GENESIS.org]] for the canonical declaration
3. Run =genesis.sh= for the reference implementation

* Document Structure

| Layer | Artifact | Purpose |
|-------+----------+---------|
| −0 | [[file:docs/RFC-0001-TPPM.md][RFC-0001-TPPM]] | Pre-system invariant |
| 0 | [[file:INDEX.org][INDEX.org]] | Orientation & addressability |
| 0′ | [[file:README.org][README.org]] | Public-facing orientation |
| 0′ | [[file:GLOSSARY.org][GLOSSARY.org]] | Language contract |
| 1 | [[file:CONVERSATION.org][CONVERSATION.org]] | Temporal emergence |
| 2 | [[file:MANIFESTO.org][MANIFESTO.org]] | Intent & values |
| 3 | [[file:REVELATION.org][REVELATION.org]] | Personal synthesis |

* Core Principle

*Only what responds may remain.*

GENESIS defines *when* something exists,
not *what* it means, *why* it exists, or *who* it serves.

* What This Is

- A boundary definition, not a belief system
- A constraint framework, not an ideology
- A method of alignment, not authority
- A system for provenance, not power

* What This Is Not

- Not a theology
- Not a governance model
- Not a truth oracle
- Not a replacement for human judgment

* Tools

- =genesis.sh= — POSIX shell implementation
- =GENESIS.canvas= — Obsidian visual structure
- Layer algebra specs in =docs/=

* Contributing

This is a frozen foundation.
