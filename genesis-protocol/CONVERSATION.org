#+TITLE: CONVERSATION
#+ROLE: Process
#+LAYER: 1

This document captures emergence through dialogue.

It records:
- questions asked
- assumptions challenged
- constraints discovered
- boundaries negotiated

*CONVERSATION is temporal.*
It may contradict itself.
It must not be judged.

Meaning emerges here,
but is never finalized here.

* Notes

This is an append-only record.
History of thought, not authority.
