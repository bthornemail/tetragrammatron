* Purpose

This manifesto asserts a single principle:

*Only what responds may remain.*

GENESIS-PROTOCOL exists to define *when* something may be said to exist,
not *what* it means, *why* it exists, or *who* it serves.

* What This Is

- A boundary definition, not a belief system
- A constraint framework, not an ideology
- A method of alignment, not authority
- A system for provenance, not power

* What This Is Not

- Not a theology
- Not a governance model
- Not a truth oracle
- Not a replacement for human judgment

* Core Commitments

- Freedom without coercion
- Autonomy without isolation
- Sovereignty without domination
- Reciprocity as the only metric of trust

* The Fourfold Discipline

We separate systems by intention:

- *INCLUDE* — what is allowed to speak
- *IGNORE* — what is left unresolved
- *SCHEMA* — what is shared and verifiable
- *SCHEME* — what is executable and contextual

No system may collapse these without loss.

* Final Statement

This manifesto does not claim correctness.
It claims responsibility.

Anything that cannot be justified,
must be excluded.
Anything that cannot respond,
must dissolve.

*Only what responds may remain.*
