* GENESIS
The act of definition prior to execution.

GENESIS does not describe meaning.
GENESIS does not describe belief.
GENESIS does not describe syntax.

GENESIS describes *structure before interpretation*.

* Layer Model (Invariant)

| Layer | Role         | Description                          |
|-------+--------------+--------------------------------------|
|    -0 | Constraint   | Hardware / physical / byte invariants |
|     0 | Index        | Positional identity                  |
|     1 | Conversation | Process / interaction                |
|     2 | Manifesto    | Intent                               |
|     3 | Revelation   | Personal synthesis                   |

This document exists at *Layer 0*.

* Primitive Combinatorial Model

GENESIS reduces all text to two primitives:

- *P0* — semantic mass
  = contiguous alphanumeric runs
  = =[[:alnum:]]+​=

- *P1* — structural projection
  = contiguous non-alphanumeric runs
  = =[^[:alnum:]]+​=

No other primitives exist.

Meaning emerges *after* projection.

---

* Fundamental Projection Rules

1. Collapse text into P0 / P1
2. Preserve order
3. Measure run length
4. Compare shapes, not symbols

Two expressions are equivalent *iff*:
- Their P0/P1 sequences match
- Their run-length polynomials match

* GENESIS as Program (Reference)

This block is a *reference*, not a dependency.

#+NAME: genesis
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cat | genesis.sh translate
#+END_SRC

Any implementation that preserves the combinatorial invariants
is a valid GENESIS.

---

* Software Constraint (Form Projection)

Alphanumeric characters preserve semantic mass.
Structure is everything else.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sed 's/[A-Za-z0-9.]/A/g'
#+END_SRC

---

* Hardware Constraint (Provenance Fingerprint)

A fixed-width byte projection.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
awk '{ printf "%02X:00:00:00:00:00:00:00\n", length($0) }'
#+END_SRC

---

* Meta-Tags (Emergent, Not Defined)

A meta-tag is any structure of the form:

P1 → P0 → P1

Examples (all equivalent):

- =[[term]]=
- =💻term💻=
- =<term>=
- =::term::=

Symbols do not matter.
Only shape matters.

* Non-Authority Clause

Org Mode is a *view*.
Markdown is a *view*.
Emoji are a *view*.

GENESIS remains valid if this file is deleted.

Only what responds can remain.

---

* Index Linkage

This document defines the origin of:

- INDEX.org
- CONVERSATION.org
- MANIFESTO.org
- REVELATION.org

Those documents project meaning.
GENESIS only defines constraint.

This file is now portable, timeless, and frozen.
